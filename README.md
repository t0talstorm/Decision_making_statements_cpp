# EXPERIMENT – Decision Statements
# Aim: To study and implement decision-making statements in C++.

## Apparatus: VS Code or Programiz Online Compiler

## Theory:
In this experiment, we explored how C++ decision-making works using if, if-else, and switch statements. These allow the program to choose between different paths based on conditions or user input.

### Program 1: Even or Odd Checker
This program asks the user to enter a number and checks whether it’s even or odd.
- It uses the modulus operator `%` to check the remainder when the number is divided by `2`.
- If the remainder is `0`, the number is `even`, else it’s `odd`.
- The logic is wrapped inside a simple `if else` statement.
This is a basic example of using conditionals to branch the output based on a simple test.

### Program 2: Vowel or Consonant Checker
Here, the user enters a single character, and the program checks whether it’s a vowel or consonant.
- It first converts the input character to lowercase using `tolower()` to make the comparison easier.
- Then it uses a chain of OR conditions (`||`) inside an `if-else` to match against the five vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`).
- If it matches, it prints that the character is a `vowel`, otherwise it's treated as a `consonant`.
This program demonstrates how logical operators work inside conditionals.

### Program 3: Largest of Three Numbers
In this program, the user is asked to enter three numbers, and the code determines which one is the largest.
- It uses a combination of `if`, `else if`, and logical conditions (`&&`) to compare all three numbers.
- It also includes a final check to see if all three numbers are equal.
- This is a good example of using nested and compound conditions to compare multiple values.

### Program 4: Traffic Light using Switch Case
This program simulates a simple traffic light system using a switch statement.
- The user selects from three choices: `1` for Red, `2` for Yellow, and `3` for Green.
- Based on the choice entered, the switch block prints the corresponding message:
  - Red -- STOP
  - Yellow -- SLOW DOWN
  - Green -- GO GO GO

This showcases how switch can be used instead of long if-else chains for multiple discrete choices.

## Conclusion:
Through these four programs, we learned how to use decision-making statements in C++, including if, else if, else, and switch. These control structures are essential for writing programs that respond differently based on user input or program state.
